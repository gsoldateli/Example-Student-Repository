## Introduction
Proud geek here! I’m a Joss Whedon fanatic and a gadget fiend. My mornings usually consist of checking the Gizmodo RSS feed while simultaneously hunting for the nearest caffeine source.

As soon as I get a new cell phone, game system, or PC the first thing I do is wipe out the OS and replace it with something that will let me play the 30 years old original Super Mario Brothers on my mint condition cutting-edge device because, I don't know, “The man” won't control me?

I work in a hospital and I really enjoy it, but in a perfect world I’d be directing a romantic comedy starring a fictionalized version of Robert Englund as himself. He falls in love with a pantophobic. It's exactly as weird as it sounds.


### Programming

My first taste of programming occurred during a C++ class I took my senior year of high school.  During the first few weeks I really struggled with the class.  I was seriously afraid of failing.  I scheduled a few one on one meetings with my programming teacher, and after three or four days something clicked.  I excelled pretty quickly once I got the basics down.  Not only did I get into an A every semester, I actually won a department award.

I seriously considered studying programming at the time but I was awfully shy.  I had this horrible image of being stuck in a cubicle coding away and never making an effort to socialize with anyone.  Not only do I suspect that image is wrong, it's a great example of avoiding a problem instead of facing it head on.  More on that later, though.

I've always regretted that decision, and I've been looking for a door into programming that was both relatively low-cost and I could work into my tight schedule.  Modern Developer seemed to fit the bill and I signed up only twenty-four hours after learning about the program.

My goal is simple: pursue a career I find both challenging and rewarding.

I knew I was on the right track when the courses delayed and I honestly missed programming during my "time off."  Ultimately, I used the time to play around a bit with Python.

### My Life

Before Modern Developer:  Write a couple more pages on that romantic comedy I’m “totally going to sell any day now.” Then possibly head to Karaoke in Chinatown. Following that, trying to convince my friends to go to "that one place that frequently plays that Taylor Swift song." Finally, accompanying my friends to “any place but that one.”

After Modern Developer:  Wake-up, coffee, code, work, more code.  Call wife.  More code.

If that sounds less exciting- well, maybe from some perspective it is.  Truth be told, I couldn't be happier.  Laser focus.

### This Assignment Needs a Cool Picture

I don't feel comfortable putting a picture of myself up, so...
