Specific Instructions for Submitting Your Answers
Inside your coursework repository, in your /Course-02-Command-Line-for-Web-Developers-and-Mastering-Git-and-GitHub/ directory, create a new subdirectory, Section-02-Mastering-Git-Part-1. You should be familiar with this process by now; type the name of the folder in the Name your file textfield.
Create a new file, answer-1.md, inside the Section-02-Mastering-Git-Part-1/ folder. Write the answer to the first question in this file.

Repeat this step for the other questions. For example, your answer to the second question will be in an answer-2.md file, and your answer to the third question will be in an answer-3.md file.

Each of your answers should follow this format:

Place the question you are answering at the top of the file, surrounded by H4 tags (E.g.: #### Question Here).

Next, include the title for your article. Remember, sometime later, your article will be published as a blog post, a Wikipedia-type article, on Encyclopedia. Use the H1 tags for the title of your article (E.g.: # Title Here).

Write a one- or two-sentence introductory paragraph.

Answer the question. Use as many paragraphs as you see fit, and use subheadings surrounded with H2 tags to divide the article into subsections. Using H2 headers (E.g.: ## Subsection Title Here) and subsections help to organize your article and improve readability by breaking up consecutive chunks of paragraphs.

You need not write a summary; instead, conclude with a closing sentence.

Add your full name, the date you completed the article, and your career path at the end of the article.
